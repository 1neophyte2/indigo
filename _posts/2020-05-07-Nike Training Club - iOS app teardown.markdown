## Nike Training Club – analysis

I have been a considerable fitness, health and nutrition enthusiast. I am more of a ‘why’ person, and that helps me to be inquisitive. Over the years, I have joined various fitness classes like gym, strength and conditioning, functional fitness and CrossFit. I used to cycle and occasionally run to my previous workplace. Being a curious person helps me to think, question and analyze many things from signboards on the highway, aisles arrangement in supermarkets, mobile apps and much more.

Since the lockdown, various fitness apps have helped me plan a workout daily. I have particularly liked Nike Training Club app over the others. Their plans integrate a running module in addition to strength and conditioning. I have used it several times in the past but have never paid attention to several aspects of the app.

Not this time, I took time and tried understanding different elements of the app as a user. Below is my understanding, observation and thoughts of Nike Training Club mobile app.

**Note: the mobile app that I have used is on the iOS platform; it could be different on Android.**

#### 1.	Nike Training Club (NTC) - Background ####

Nike has been pushing boundaries in health-tech for some time now. I remember their early Nike+ Sports band kit (2008), Nike+ fuel bands (2013) that promised individuals of an active lifestyle. They were the pioneers in bringing this new accessible tech to consumers.
Nike Training Club (NTC). Over the years, most health tech companies have offered their product as a mobile-only.

#### 2.	Registration ####

Nike has always been community-centric when it comes to their product launches, and it reflects in the language they have used throughout NTC. When you open the app for a new user, the screen mentions ‘Join’ instead of ‘Sign-up or Register’.

Once the individual registers, it asks a few questions to personalize the experience. At this stage, I found a few interesting things

- I didn’t get any email from NTC about the app to the registered email address
- In the registration page though, it says sign-in instead of login. Whoopsies.
- If you look closely, you cannot skip the onboarding process
- It doesn’t distract the user from uploading a display picture at this stage
