## Nike Training Club – analysis

I have been a considerable fitness, health and nutrition enthusiast. I am more of a ‘why’ person, and that helps me to be inquisitive. Over the years, I have joined various fitness classes like gym, strength and conditioning, functional fitness and CrossFit. I used to cycle and occasionally run to my previous workplace. Being a curious person helps me to think, question and analyze many things from signboards on the highway, aisles arrangement in supermarkets, mobile apps and much more.

Since the lockdown, various fitness apps have helped me plan a workout daily. I have particularly liked Nike Training Club app over the others. Their plans integrate a running module in addition to strength and conditioning. I have used it several times in the past but have never paid attention to several aspects of the app.

Not this time, I took time and tried understanding different elements of the app as a user. Below is my understanding, observation and thoughts of Nike Training Club mobile app.

**Note: the mobile app that I have used is on the iOS platform; it could be different on Android.**
